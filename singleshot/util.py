        Generate batches of samples and corresponding labels indefinitely from
        lists of filenames and labels.

        Returns two numpy arrays, one containing the next `batch_size` samples
        from `filenames`, the other containing the corresponding labels from
        `labels`.

        Shuffles `filenames` and `labels` consistently after each complete pass.

        Can perform image transformations for data conversion and data augmentation.
        `resize`, `gray`, and `equalize` are image conversion tools and should be
        used consistently during training and inference. The remaining transformations
        serve for data augmentation. Each data augmentation process can set its own
        independent application probability. The transformations are performed
        in the order of their arguments, i.e. equalization is performed first,
        grayscale conversion is performed last.

        `prob` works the same way in all arguments in which it appears. It must be a float in [0,1]
        and determines the probability that the respective transform is applied to any given image.

        All conversions and transforms default to `False`.

        Arguments:
            batch_size (int, optional): The size of the batches to be generated. Defaults to 32.
            train (bool, optional): Whether or not the generator is used in training mode. If `True`, then the labels
                will be transformed into the format that the SSD cost function requires. Otherwise,
                the output format of the labels is identical to the input format. Defaults to `True`.
            ssd_box_encoder (SSDBoxEncoder, optional): Only required if `train = True`. An SSDBoxEncoder object
                to encode the ground truth labels to the required format for training an SSD model.
            equalize (bool, optional): If `True`, performs histogram equalization on the images.
                This can improve contrast and lead the improved model performance.
            brightness (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple containing three floats, `(min, max, prob)`.
                Scales the brightness of the image by a factor randomly picked from a uniform
                distribution in the boundaries of `[min, max]`. Both min and max must be >=0.
            flip (float, optional): `False` or a float in [0,1], see `prob` above. Flip the image horizontally.
                The respective box coordinates are adjusted accordingly.
            translate (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple, with the first two elements tuples containing
                two integers each, and the third element a float: `((min, max), (min, max), prob)`.
                The first tuple provides the range in pixels for horizontal shift of the image,
                the second tuple for vertical shift. The number of pixels to shift the image
                by is uniformly distributed within the boundaries of `[min, max]`, i.e. `min` is the number
                of pixels by which the image is translated at least. Both `min` and `max` must be >=0.
                The respective box coordinates are adjusted accordingly.
            scale (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple containing three floats, `(min, max, prob)`.
                Scales the image by a factor randomly picked from a uniform distribution in the boundaries
                of `[min, max]`. Both min and max must be >=0.
            random_crop (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple of four integers, `(height, width, min_1_object, max_#_trials)`,
                where `height` and `width` are the height and width of the patch that is to be cropped out at a random
                position in the input image. Note that `height` and `width` can be arbitrary - they are allowed to be larger
                than the image height and width, in which case the original image will be randomly placed on a black background
                canvas of size `(height, width)`. `min_1_object` is either 0 or 1. If 1, there must be at least one detectable
                object remaining in the image for the crop to be valid, and if 0, crops with no detectable objects left in the
                image patch are allowed. `max_#_trials` is only relevant if `min_1_object == 1` and sets the maximum number
                of attempts to get a valid crop. If no valid crop was obtained within this maximum number of attempts,
                the respective image will be removed from the batch without replacement (i.e. for each removed image, the batch
                will be one sample smaller). Defaults to `False`.
            crop (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple of four integers, `(crop_top, crop_bottom, crop_left, crop_right)`,
                with the number of pixels to crop off of each side of the images.
                The targets are adjusted accordingly. Note: Cropping happens before resizing.
            resize (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple of 2 integers for the desired output
                size of the images in pixels. The expected format is `(width, height)`.
                The box coordinates are adjusted accordingly. Note: Resizing happens after cropping.
            rgb_to_gray (bool, optional): If `True`, converts the images to grayscale assuming they are in RGB.
            gray_to_rgb (bool, optional): If `True`, converts the images to RGB assuming they are grayscale.
            multispectral_to_rgb (bool, optional): If `True`, converts the images to RGB assuming they are 8-band.
            limit_boxes (bool, optional): If `True`, limits box coordinates to stay within image boundaries
                post any transformation. This should always be set to `True`, even if you set `include_thresh`
                to 0. I don't even know why I made this an option. If this is set to `False`, you could
                end up with some boxes that lie entirely outside the image boundaries after a given transformation
                and such boxes would of course not make any sense and have a strongly adverse effect on the learning.
            include_thresh (float, optional): Only relevant if `limit_boxes` is `True`. Determines the minimum
                fraction of the area of a ground truth box that must be left after limiting in order for the box
                to still be included in the batch data. If set to 0, all boxes are kept except those which lie
                entirely outside of the image bounderies after limiting. If set to 1, only boxes that did not
                need to be limited at all are kept. Defaults to 0.3.
            diagnostics (bool, optional): If `True`, yields three additional output items:
                1) A list of the image file names in the batch.
                2) An array with the original, unaltered images.
                3) A list with the original, unaltered labels.
                This can be useful for diagnostic purposes. Defaults to `False`. Only works if `train = True`.

        Yields:
            The next batch as a tuple containing a Numpy array that contains the images and a python list
            that contains the corresponding labels for each image as 2D Numpy arrays. The output format
            of the labels is according to the `box_output_format` that was specified in the constructor.

        Perform offline image processing.

        This function the same image processing capabilities as the generator function above,
        but it performs the processing on all items in `filenames` starting at index `start`
        until index `stop` and saves the processed images to disk. The labels are adjusted
        accordingly.

        Processing images offline is useful to reduce the amount of work done by the batch
        generator and thus can speed up training. For example, transformations that are performed
        on all images in a deterministic way, such as resizing or cropping, should be done offline.

        Arguments:
            dest_path (str, optional): The destination directory where the processed images
                and `labels.csv` should be saved, ending on a slash.
            start (int, optional): The inclusive start index from which onward to process the
                items in `filenames`. Defaults to 0.
            stop (int, optional): The exclusive stop index until which to process the
                items in `filenames`. Defaults to 'all', meaning to process all items until the
                end of the list.

        For a description of the other arguments, please refer to the documentation of `generate_batch()` above.

        Returns:
            `None`, but saves all processed images as JPEG files to the specified destination
            directory and generates a `labels.csv` CSV file that is saved to the same directory.
            The format of the lines in the destination CSV file is the same as that of the
            source CSV file, i.e. `[frame, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, class_id]`.

    Arguments:
        boxes1 (np.array): Either a 1D Numpy array of shape `(4, )` containing the coordinates for one box in the
            format specified by `coords` or a 2D Numpy array of shape `(n, 4)` containing the coordinates for `n` boxes.

def greedy_nms(y_pred_decoded, iou_threshold=0.45, coords='minmax'):
    """
    Perform greedy non-maximum suppression on the input boxes.

    Greedy NMS works by selecting the box with the highest score and
    removing all boxes around it that are too close to it measured by IoU-similarity.
    Out of the boxes that are left over, once again the one with the highest
    score is selected and so on, until no boxes with too much overlap are left.

    This is a basic, straight-forward NMS algorithm that is relatively efficient,
    but it has a number of downsides. One of those downsides is that the box with
    the highest score might not always be the box with the best fit to the object.
    There are more sophisticated NMS techniques like [this one](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/506283/1/3924_postprint.pdf)
    that use a combination of nearby boxes, but in general there will probably
    always be a trade-off between speed and quality for any given NMS technique.

    Arguments:
        y_pred_decoded (list): A batch of decoded predictions. For a given batch size `n` this
            is a list of length `n` where each list element is a 2D Numpy array.
            For a batch item with `k` predicted boxes this 2D Numpy array has
            shape `(k, 6)`, where each row contains the coordinates of the respective
            box in the format `[class_id, score, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax]`.
            Technically, the number of columns doesn't have to be 6, it can be
            arbitrary as long as the first four elements of each row are
            `xmin`, `xmax`, `ymin`, `ymax` (in this order) and the last element
            is the score assigned to the prediction. Note that this function is
            agnostic to the scale of the score or what it represents.
        iou_threshold (float, optional): All boxes with a Jaccard similarity of
            greater than `iou_threshold` with a locally maximal box will be removed
            from the set of predictions, where 'maximal' refers to the box score.
            Defaults to 0.45 following the paper.
        coords (str, optional): The coordinate format of `y_pred_decoded`.
            Can be one of the formats supported by `iou()`. Defaults to 'minmax'.

    Returns:
        The predictions after removing non-maxima. The format is the same as the input format.

    Convert model prediction output back to a format that contains only the positive box predictions

    After the decoding, two stages of prediction filtering are performed for each class individually:
    First confidence thresholding, then greedy non-maximum suppression. The filtering results for all
    classes are concatenated and the `top_k` overall highest confidence results constitute the final
    predictions for a given batch item. This procedure follows the original Caffe implementation.
    For a slightly different and more efficient alternative to decode raw model output that performs
    non-maximum suppresion globally instead of per class, see `decode_y2()` below.

            of shape `(batch_size, #boxes, #classes + 4 + 4 + 4)`, where `#boxes` is the total number of
            boxes predicted by the model per image and the last axis contains
            `[one-hot vector for the classes, 4 predicted coordinate offsets, 4 anchor box coordinates, 4 variances]`.
        confidence_thresh (float, optional): A float in [0,1), the minimum classification confidence in a specific
            positive class in order to be considered for the non-maximum suppression stage for the respective class.
            A lower value will result in a larger part of the selection process being done by the non-maximum suppression
            stage, while a larger value will result in a larger part of the selection process happening in the confidence
            thresholding stage. Defaults to 0.01, following the paper.
        iou_threshold (float, optional): A float in [0,1]. All boxes with a Jaccard similarity of greater than `iou_threshold`
            with a locally maximal box will be removed from the set of predictions for a given class, where 'maximal' refers
            to the box score. Defaults to 0.45 following the paper.
        top_k (int, optional): The number of highest scoring predictions to be kept for each batch item after the
            non-maximum suppression stage. Defaults to 200, following the paper.
        input_coords (str, optional): The box coordinate format that the model outputs. Can be either 'centroids'
            for the format `(cx, cy, w, h)` (box center coordinates, width, and height) or 'minmax'
            for the format `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`. Defaults to 'centroids'.
        normalize_coords (bool, optional): Set to `True` if the model outputs relative coordinates (i.e. coordinates in [0,1])
            and you wish to transform these relative coordinates back to absolute coordinates. If the model outputs
            relative coordinates, but you do not want to convert them back to absolute coordinates, set this to `False`.
            Do not set this to `True` if the model already outputs absolute coordinates, as that would result in incorrect
            coordinates. Requires `img_height` and `img_width` if set to `True`. Defaults to `False`.

    Returns:
        A python list of length `batch_size` where each list element represents the predicted boxes
        for one image and contains a Numpy array of shape `(boxes, 6)` where each row is a box prediction for

    for the background class. It is much more efficient than the procedure of the original implementation, but the
    results may also differ.

    Arguments:
        y_pred (array): The prediction output of the SSD model, expected to be a Numpy array
            of shape `(batch_size, #boxes, #classes + 4 + 4 + 4)`, where `#boxes` is the total number of
            boxes predicted by the model per image and the last axis contains
            `[one-hot vector for the classes, 4 predicted coordinate offsets, 4 anchor box coordinates, 4 variances]`.
        confidence_thresh (float, optional): A float in [0,1), the minimum classification confidence in any positive
            class required for a given box to be considered a positive prediction. A lower value will result
            in better recall, while a higher value will result in better precision. Do not use this parameter with the
            goal to combat the inevitably many duplicates that an SSD will produce, the subsequent non-maximum suppression
            stage will take care of those. Defaults to 0.5.
        iou_threshold (float, optional): `None` or a float in [0,1]. If `None`, no non-maximum suppression will be
            performed. If not `None`, greedy NMS will be performed after the confidence thresholding stage, meaning
            all boxes with a Jaccard similarity of greater than `iou_threshold` with a locally maximal box will be removed
            from the set of predictions, where 'maximal' refers to the box score. Defaults to 0.45.
        top_k (int, optional): 'all' or an integer with number of highest scoring predictions to be kept for each batch item
            after the non-maximum suppression stage. Defaults to 'all', in which case all predictions left after the NMS stage
            will be kept.
        input_coords (str, optional): The box coordinate format that the model outputs. Can be either 'centroids'
            for the format `(cx, cy, w, h)` (box center coordinates, width, and height) or 'minmax'
            for the format `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`. Defaults to 'centroids'.
        normalize_coords (bool, optional): Set to `True` if the model outputs relative coordinates (i.e. coordinates in [0,1])
            and you wish to transform these relative coordinates back to absolute coordinates. If the model outputs
            relative coordinates, but you do not want to convert them back to absolute coordinates, set this to `False`.
            Do not set this to `True` if the model already outputs absolute coordinates, as that would result in incorrect
            coordinates. Requires `img_height` and `img_width` if set to `True`. Defaults to `False`.
        img_height (int, optional): The height of the input images. Only needed if `normalize_coords` is `True`.
        img_width (int, optional): The width of the input images. Only needed if `normalize_coords` is `True`.

    Returns:
        A python list of length `batch_size` where each list element represents the predicted boxes
        for one image and contains a Numpy array of shape `(boxes, 6)` where each row is a box prediction for
        a non-background class for the respective image in the format `[class_id, confidence, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax]`.

            n_classes (int): The number of classes including the background class.
            predictor_sizes (list): A list of int-tuples of the format `(height, width)`
                containing the output heights and widths of the convolutional predictor layers.
            min_scale (float, optional): The smallest scaling factor for the size of the anchor boxes as a fraction
                of the shorter side of the input images. Defaults to 0.1. Note that you should set the scaling factors
                such that the resulting anchor box sizes correspond to the sizes of the objects you are trying

            max_scale (float, optional): The largest scaling factor for the size of the anchor boxes as a fraction
                of the shorter side of the input images. All scaling factors between the smallest and the
                largest will be linearly interpolated. Note that the second to last of the linearly interpolated
                scaling factors will actually be the scaling factor for the last predictor layer, while the last
                scaling factor is used for the second box for aspect ratio 1 in the last predictor layer
                if `two_boxes_for_ar1` is `True`. Defaults to 0.9. Note that you should set the scaling factors
                such that the resulting anchor box sizes correspond to the sizes of the objects you are trying
                to detect.
            scales (list, optional): A list of floats containing scaling factors per convolutional predictor layer.
                This list must be one element longer than the number of predictor layers. The first `k` elements are the
                scaling factors for the `k` predictor layers, while the last element is used for the second box
                for aspect ratio 1 in the last predictor layer if `two_boxes_for_ar1` is `True`. This additional
                last scaling factor must be passed either way, even if it is not being used.
                Defaults to `None`. If a list is passed, this argument overrides `min_scale` and
                `max_scale`. All scaling factors must be greater than zero. Note that you should set the scaling factors

            aspect_ratios_global (list, optional): The list of aspect ratios for which anchor boxes are to be
                generated. This list is valid for all prediction layers. Defaults to [0.5, 1.0, 2.0]. Note that you should
                set the aspect ratios such that the resulting anchor box shapes very roughly correspond to the shapes of the
                objects you are trying to detect. For many standard detection tasks, the default values will yield good
                results.
            aspect_ratios_per_layer (list, optional): A list containing one aspect ratio list for each prediction layer.
                If a list is passed, it overrides `aspect_ratios_global`. Defaults to `None`. Note that you should
                set the aspect ratios such that the resulting anchor box shapes very roughly correspond to the shapes of the
                objects you are trying to detect. For many standard detection tasks, the default values will yield good
                results.
            two_boxes_for_ar1 (bool, optional): Only relevant for aspect ratios lists that contain 1. Will be ignored otherwise.
                If `True`, two anchor boxes will be generated for aspect ratio 1. The first will be generated
                using the scaling factor for the respective layer, the second one will be generated using
                geometric mean of said scaling factor and next bigger scaling factor.
            limit_boxes (bool, optional): If `True`, limits box coordinates to stay within image boundaries.
                Defaults to `True`.
            variances (list, optional): A list of 4 floats >0 with scaling factors (actually it's not factors but divisors
                to be precise) for the encoded ground truth (i.e. target) box coordinates. A variance value of 1.0 would apply
                no scaling at all to the targets, while values in (0,1) upscale the encoded targets and values greater than 1.0
                downscale the encoded targets. If you want to reproduce the configuration of the original SSD,
                set this to `[0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2]`, provided the coordinate format is 'centroids'. Defaults to `[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]`.
            pos_iou_threshold (float, optional): The intersection-over-union similarity threshold that must be
                met in order to match a given ground truth box to a given anchor box. Defaults to 0.5.
            neg_iou_threshold (float, optional): The maximum allowed intersection-over-union similarity of an
                anchor box with any ground truth box to be labeled a negative (i.e. background) box. If an
                anchor box is neither a positive, nor a negative box, it will be ignored during training.
            coords (str, optional): The box coordinate format to be used internally in the model (i.e. this is not the input format
                of the ground truth labels). Can be either 'centroids' for the format `(cx, cy, w, h)` (box center coordinates, width,
                and height) or 'minmax' for the format `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`. Defaults to 'centroids'.
            normalize_coords (bool, optional): If `True`, the encoder uses relative instead of absolute coordinates.
                This means instead of using absolute tartget coordinates, the encoder will scale all coordinates to be within [0,1].
                This way learning becomes independent of the input image size. Defaults to `False`.

        Note that all tensor creation, reshaping and concatenation operations performed in this function
        and the sub-functions it calls are identical to those performed inside the conv net model. This, of course,
        must be the case in order to preserve the spatial meaning of each box prediction, but it's useful to make
        yourself aware of this fact and why it is necessary.

        In other words, the boxes in `y_encoded` must have a specific order in order correspond to the right spatial
        positions and scales of the boxes predicted by the model. The sequence of operations here ensures that `y_encoded`
        has this specific form.

            the ground truth labels for training. The last axis has length `#classes + 8` because the model
